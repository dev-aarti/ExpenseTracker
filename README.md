# ExpenseTracker
A simple full-stack Expense Tracker application built with React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and MySQL (database).The frontend allows users to add, edit, and delete expense records.  All expense data is stored in a MySQL database via RESTful API endpoints provided by the Express backend. The UI updates automatically after any change.
